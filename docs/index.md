# Claude Code Agentic Workflow Workshop

Welcome to the hands-on workshop for mastering Claude Code's agentic capabilities.

---

## Workshop Overview

In this workshop, you'll transform Claude Code from a simple AI assistant into a powerful, automated development partner. You'll learn by doing - implementing the same feature twice (before and after setup) to see the real difference.

## Prerequisites

- Git installed
- Node.js 18+ or Bun installed
- VS Code (recommended)
- Anthropic API key

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/revity-workshop-app.git
cd revity-workshop-app

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Add your TMDB_API_KEY to .env.local

# Run the app
bun dev
```

## The Challenge

You'll implement **infinite scrolling** for the movie list twice:

1. **First time (Section 2)**: With zero Claude Code setup
2. **Second time (Section 9)**: With full agentic setup

Same task. Same codebase. Completely different experience.
