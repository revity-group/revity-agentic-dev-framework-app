# Section 6: MCP Servers

Extend Claude's capabilities by connecting to external tools and services through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

---

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open standard that lets Claude connect to external data sources and tools. Think of MCP servers as plugins that give Claude new superpowers:

- **Access external data** - Databases, APIs, file systems
- **Use specialized tools** - Browsers, search engines, development tools
- **Integrate services** - Slack, GitHub, Jira, and more

Instead of Claude being limited to the tools built into Claude Code, MCP lets you connect to an ecosystem of servers.
