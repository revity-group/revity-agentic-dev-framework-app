# Section 0: Introduction

Welcome to the Agentic Development Workshop. Before we dive into hands-on exercises, let's set the stage.

---

## Presentation

We'll start with a presentation covering:

- LLMs: How they work and their capabilities
- Agents: Autonomous AI that plans, executes, and iterates
- MCP (Model Context Protocol): Connecting AI to external tools and data
- Agents in the SDLC: Where AI fits in the development lifecycle

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Agentic Workflow** | AI that autonomously plans, executes, and iterates on tasks |
| **Context Management** | How Claude understands your project without repeated explanations |
| **Tool Use** | Claude's ability to read files, run commands, and make edits |
| **Guardrails** | Permissions, hooks, and conventions that ensure quality output |

---

## What We'll Build

By the end of this workshop, you'll transform Claude Code from a generic assistant into a project-aware development partner that:

- Knows your tech stack and conventions (CLAUDE.md)
- Runs pre-configured workflows (Slash Commands)
- Automatically validates code quality (Hooks)
- Accesses external tools and data (MCP Servers)
